%  Spreads a force on the Lagrangian points, Xl to the fluid 
%     at pts (X,Y)
%  
%  Returns:
%     f = force on fluid 
%
%  Input:
%     F      = force at Lagrangian points
%     Xl     = location of Lagrangian points
%     X      = N*N vector of X location of fluid mesh point
%     Y      = ", but Y locations
%     dtheta = lagrangian point spacing
%     N      = number of mesh points in each direction
%     h      = mesh width
